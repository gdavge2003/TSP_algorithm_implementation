# TSP_algorithm_implementation
CS325 Project - Examining a polynomial heuristic for the NP-Hard TSP

For CS325 Grading:
Please use our Nearest Insertion heuristic for verifying results and grading!
- The program can be found in nearest_insertion_heurstic/
- Run instructions: 
  - Must use Python 3.2+ to run! (flip server has 3.4.5, please use 'python3' to run in shell)
  - All source cide in nearest_insertion_heuristic. Please do not separate.
  - Run in terminal with command: "python3 main.py <file name>"
    - Ex: "python3 main.py tsp_exapmle_1.txt"
- Please see the folder nearest_insertion_heuristic/tsp_problems for .tour files for results that are already generated by this algorithm.

Run Instructions:
Each folder contains a different implementation to solve TSP, along with their own respective README. Please refer to each implementation's particular README for instructions on how to run.
