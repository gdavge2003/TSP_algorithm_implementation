Run Instructions:
- MUST use python 3.2+ to run!
- Nearest Insertion Heuristic: all source code in folder 'nearest_insertion_heuristic'. Do not separate them. Run by using the terminal command: python3 main.py <tsp_problem.txt>

- Please see the folder tsp_problems for .tour files for results that are already generated by this algorithm.
