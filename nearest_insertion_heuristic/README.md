# TSP_algorithm_implementation
CS325 Project - Examining a polynomial heuristic for the NP-Hard TSP

Run Instructions:
- MUST use python 3.2+ to run!
- Nearest Insertion Heuristic: all source code in folder 'nearest_insertion_heuristic'. Do not separate them.
- Run by using the terminal command: "python3 main.py <tsp_problem.txt>"
   - Ex: "python3 main.py tsp_example_1.txt"

- Please see the folder tsp_problems for .tour files for results that are already generated by this algorithm:
